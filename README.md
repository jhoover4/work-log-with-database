# Work Log with a Database

This is the fourth project in Treehouse Python tech degree.

To use run work_log.py.

To test run tests.py.

## Description

Create a command line application that will allow employees to enter their name, time worked, task worked on, 
and general notes about the task into a database. 

There should be a way to add a new entry, list all entries for a 
particular employee, and list all entries that match a date or search term. Print a report of this information to the 
screen, including the date, title of task, time spent, employee, and general notes.

## Extra Credit

- Records can be deleted and edited, 
letting user change the date, task name, time spent, 
and/or notes.
- Can find entries based on a ranges of dates.
- If multiple employees share a name 
a list of possible matches is given.
- Records are displayed one at a time 
with the ability to page through records (previous/next/back).
- As a fellow developer of the script, 
I should see test coverage of 85% of the code or better
